Code Louisville Final Project
=============================

This is a website built for a local commercial refrigeration company and as my Code Louisville final project.

My focus was a simple mobile-first design that would be presentable on most devices and across all browsers. Created with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript using the Jquery library and the Bootstrap 4 framework.

The back-end uses Node and Express to handle form data and send an e-mail to customers who fill out the form. 

To view the project:
+ `git clone` repository
+ navigate to containing folder
+ run `git checkout express-back-end`
+ run `npm install`
+ run `npm start`
+ navigate your browser to `localhost:3000`
