Code Louisville Final Project
=============================

This is a website built for a local commercial refrigeration company and as my Code Louisville final project.

My focus was a simple mobile-first design that would be presentable on most devices and across all browsers. Created with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript using the Bootstrap 4 and Jquery frameworks. 

To view the project:
+ `git clone` repository
+ navigate to containing folder
+ open `index.html`
